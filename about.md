*Data analytics professional interested in technology and internet, markets, energy, politics and travel.*

I've been based in the Bay Area since '03 but I am originally from  [Dhaka](http://carmudi.com.bd/journal/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/image_250_51708.jpg), I've lived in a few other traffic congested cities in Asia, namely Beijing, Kuala Lumpur and Manila and very briefly in Istanbul.

In a former life I worked as a data analyst in economic consulting for finance related litigation clients (you can read more about a case I worked on [here](http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-the-nyse-floor-20141007-column.html) and [here](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB106626772618980300)). After grad school I was predicting energy prices in the [California energy markets](http://www.caiso.com/Pages/default.aspx) for utilities, municipalities and power traders (for a brief intro to energy markets [read this](http://www.energysmart.enernoc.com/regulated-and-deregulated-energy-markets-explained/)).

Most recently, I was a Product Manager for an in-development web application geared towards collaborative data analysis and visualization. Currently, I am a Data Science Fellow at Metis.
